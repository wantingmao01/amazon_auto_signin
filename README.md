## About this repo
This is a practice for web scraping using Xpath and the python package, selennium. By running amazon_signin.py in the terminal, users can log into their amazon accounts automatically.

## How to run it?
1. Download amazon_signin.py
2. Install [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html).
3. At line 14 and 20, for strings, "EMAIL or USER_NAME" and "PASSWORD", please replace them with your own email/amazon username and password.
4. Make sure you have Chrome.
5. Run it in terminal and enjoy auto sign in!

## Something to notice
This repo may only fit a specific verson of the webpage. For instance, the sign in bar is at a particular place. For my own experience, if you get on amazon for multiple times in a small time period, you may be led to another version of its webpage.
